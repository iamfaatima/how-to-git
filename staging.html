            Staging files
            After initializing a git repository in the chosen directory, all files will now be tracked. Any changes made to any file will be shown after a $ git status as changes not staged for commit.
            
            To stage changes for commit you need to add the file(s) - or in other words, stage file(s).
            
            # Adding a file
            $ git add filename
            
            # Adding all files
            $ git add -A
            
            # Adding all files changes in a directory
            $ git add .
            
            # Choosing what changes to add (this will got through all your changes and you can 'Y' or 'N' the changes)
            $ git add -p</p>
