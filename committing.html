            Committing files
            After adding/staging a file, the next step is to commit staged file(s)
            
            # Commit staged file(s)
            $ git commit -m 'commit message'
            
            # Add file and commit
            $ git commit filename -m 'commit message'
            
            # Add file and commit staged file
            $ git commit -am 'insert commit message'
            
            # Amending a commit
            $ git commit --amend 'new commit message' or no message to maintain previous message
            
            # Squashing commits together
            $ git rebase -i
            This will give you an interface on your core editor:
            # Commands:
            #  p, pick = use commit
            #  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
            #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
            #  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
            #  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
            #  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
            
            # Squashing commits together using reset --soft
            $ git reset --soft HEAD~number_of_commits
            $ git commit
            ** WARNING: this will require force pushing commits</p>
