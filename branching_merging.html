            Branching and merging
            # Creating a local branch
            $ git checkout -b branchname
            
            # Switching between 2 branches (in fact, this would work on terminal as well to switch between 2 directories - $ cd -)
            $ git checkout -
            
            # Pushing local branch to remote
            $ git push -u origin branchname
            
            # Deleting a local branch - this won't let you delete a branch that hasn't been merged yet
            $ git branch -d branchname
            
            # Deleting a local branch - this WILL delete a branch even if it hasn't been merged yet!
            $ git branch -D branchname
            
            # Remove any remote refs you have locally that have been removed from your remote (you can substitute <origin> to any remote branch)
            $ git remote prune origin
            
            # Viewing all branches, including local and remote branches
            $ git branch -a
            
            # Viewing all branches that have been merged into your current branch, including local and remote
            $ git branch -a --merged
            
            # Viewing all branches that haven't been merged into your current branch, including local and remote
            $ git branch -a --no-merged
            
            # Viewing local branches
            $ git branch
            
            # Viewing remote branches
            $ git branch -r
            
            # Rebase master branch into local branch
            $ git rebase origin/master
            
            # Pushing local branch after rebasing master into local branch
            $ git push origin +branchname
            Fetching and checking out remote branches
            # This will fetch all the remote branches for you.
            $ git fetch origin
            
            # With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in, giving you a local working copy:
            $ git checkout -b test origin/test
            
            # Deleting a remote branch
            $ git branch -rd origin/branchname
            $ git push origin --delete branchname  or  $ git push origin:branchname
            Merging branch to trunk/master
            # First checkout trunk/master
            $ git checkout trunk/master
            
            # Now merge branch to trunk/master
            $ git merge branchname
            
            # To cancel a merge
            $ git merge --abort
            Updating a local repository with changes from a Github repository
            $ git pull origin master
            Tracking existing branch
            $ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/foo foo</p>
