            Checking the status of your files
            The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the $ git status command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:
            
            $ git status
            # On branch master
            nothing to commit (working directory clean)
            If you add a new file to your project, and the file didn't exist before, when you run a $ git status you should see your untracked file like this:
            
            $ git status
            # On branch master
            # Untracked files:
            #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            #
            #   README
            nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</p>
